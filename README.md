## Introduction

Welcome to the Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction Project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. The aim is to provide insights into the reusability of rocket launches, contributing to cost-effective space exploration.

## Project Overview

- Predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.
- Determine the cost-effectiveness of launches based on landing outcomes.
- Compare SpaceX's reusability to other providers in terms of cost savings.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Utilized SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia to gather launch data.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and standardized data using Python's pandas library.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed data patterns using matplotlib, seaborn, and SQL queries.
4. **Interactive Visual Analytics:** Created dynamic maps and interactive visualizations with Folium and Plotly Dash.
5. **Predictive Analysis:** Employed logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree classifier models.

## Data Collection

- Collected data through direct interaction with the SpaceX API and web scraping from a dedicated Wikipedia page.
- Integrated data from both sources for comprehensive analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized data characteristics using matplotlib, seaborn, and SQL queries.
- Explored insights from cleaned and refined dataset.

## Predictive Analysis

- Employed four classification models: logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree classifier.
- Systematically built, tuned, and evaluated each model.
- Determined the best-performing model for predicting Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/falcon-9-prediction.git`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main project file: `python main.py`

## Usage

- Modify model parameters in the `config.py` file.
- Analyze EDA results in the `notebooks/` directory.
- Visualize interactive plots using `interactive_visualizations/` resources.
